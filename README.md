I'm Rice, and I'm a software developer. I love to create, innovate, and solve problems using the power of code. I'm just a kid with big dreams and an even bigger love for software development.

My Skills:

Java: I love tackling complex problems and making games.
JavaScript: I build dynamic and interactive web applications with JavaScript.
Python: Python is my go-to for making cool scripts that make life easier.
HTML: Technically it's a markup language, but I don't really care.
CSS: Same with HTML, but I can make different STYLES!
PHP: I use this to make backend scripts, such as surveys.
